# avidf-task-12

Note from the coder: My initial plan was to make an app and implement cellular automata and Game of Life in it but I got a pretty bad cold during the week and I had to readjust my plans 

This is an implementation of fractals from Nature of Code 
It contains a simulation of a tree and a L-tree


To run the code install and use python and pygame
